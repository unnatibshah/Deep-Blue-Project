CNNs are useful in numerous applications, such as signal processing, image processing, and computer vision. In this regard, various CNN-CC algorithms were proposed to cope with major issues like occlusion, low visibility, inter- and intraobject variation, and scale variation due to different perspectives. A generic CNN-CC flow diagram is shown in Figure that depicts two approaches. The first, on the left, found ground-truth density (GTD) except for the last two blocks, which were used for comparison and error computation. The second, on the right, computed ED and crowd counting. The description of each block is as follows.

##### General form of CNN-CC algorithm. Crowd-counting mechanism starts from object annotation in an image to density estimation; object counting is depicted. General framework of crowd counting (top), and CNN working is expanded (bottom).

### Annotation

Terms used:

- Labelling: In machine learning, annotation is a process of labeling data such as text, audio, and image. The annotated data are used by a computer or computers to recognize similar patterns in unseen data. There are different annotation categories, such as bounding-box annotation, polygonal segmentation, line annotation, landmark annotation, 3D cuboids, and dot annotation [67]. These different types of annotations are used to obtain the ground truth. In crowd counting, dot annotation is the first step to compute the GTD, and it is carried through various scientific tools like Labelbox, LabelMe, and RectLabel [10].

- GTD computation: Ground truth can be defined as the information provided by direct observation instead of inference. There are different ways to obtain the GTD, such as Gaussian kernel, geometry-adaptive kernel, and GANs [8]. The geometry-adaptive kernel performs better than the Gaussian kernel. This is due considering spread-factor-based geometric information. Further, a combination of generative and discriminative networks brings the generated image very close to the original one. Therefore, the obtained GTD from GANs has better quality as compared to that of the Gaussian, geometry, or body-aware techniques.

- GTD and ED comparison: In crowd counting, ED and GTD are compared to compute the loss between estimated output and ground truth. In the literature, different techniques were employed to compute loss, such as cross-entropy and MSE [17]. A combination of sigmoid and MSE converge much slower as compared to sigmoid and cross-entropy due to the gradient-vanishing problem. Cross-entropy, on the other hand, performs well on classification problems, but better performance was shown in terms of MSE in regression-based problems.

- Weight Computation: After comparing the loss between ED and GTD, the next step is to update the network weight to minimize loss. The updated weight is computed by Wnew=Wold+η∂L∂W. This weight update process (backpropagated to the CNN) is terminated when loss is minimized (process converges). Wold and Wnew depict the old and new weights, where the last term is the combination of learning rate η and change in loss with respect to weight [17].

- CNN: In CNN-CC, the image is first fed into the CNN that consists of convolution, ReLU, pooling, and FCL, as depicted in Figure 3 (bottom). The CNN functions by extracting image features in the form of a feature map. These features are fed into the regression model for estimating the density map for crowd counting. CNN can be categorized into single, multi-, and single with scale-aware networks. Depending on the application, the complexity (single–multi column) and layers of CNN can be optimized to obtain the desired results. These categories are further optimized to provide strong and granular-level foundation for researchers in the future.

- Density estimation: It can be defined as a way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable on the basis of observed (ground-truth) data. There are different ways to obtain the ED of a crowd, like density estimation by clustering, detection, and regression [3,7,13,68]. Detection-based techniques perform well with sparse crowds, while regression-based methods perform well on dense-crowd environment, and they overestimate crowds in sparse patches. A combination of detection and regression can be used to achieve better performance in both sparse and dense scenarios.

- Counting: It is a method that is performed after the computation of a density map to count the number of objects (people, cells, cars, etc.) in an image or video. Different well-known handcrafted techniques perform according to image density [10]. For example, in sparse-density images, counting by detection performs well due to a lack of overlapping objects, while CNN-based methods perform well on images with a diverse density range.

Unique challenges faced by CNN-CC algorithms include a complex network architecture, increased number of parameters, high computational cost, and real-time deployment. Traditional handcrafted crowd-counting algorithms can be deployed for real-time monitoring at the cost of reduced accuracy and a low-resolution density map. These techniques also fail to obtain the desired results in high occlusion, a diverse density range, and scale-varied environments. On the other hand, CNN-CC algorithms perform better in terms of prediction accuracy and resolution. Traditional handcrafted methods have less computational cost. The majority of applications aim for high prediction accuracy. Many researchers tried and succeeded to minimize complexity. Hence, growing trends towards CNN-CC techniques motivated us to review and analyze the latest and most well-known research articles on the most challenging datasets.
